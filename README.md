## WELCOME to Preprint Journal Club for ALL!!!

### What are preprints?
[Preprints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjxRAhdbJu8&feature=youtu.be&t=5m36s) are complete pieces of scientific work that have not yet been peer reviewed or published. A preprint is often the exact same manuscript that is submitted to a journal, is stored on a freely accessible public server, and is available to the whole web community within 1-2 days of submission. 

### How can preprints help fix the problems in publishing in biology?
Publishing in the biological sciences has become a much lenghtier process over the past 30 years and can take 1-2 years from journal submission to final publication. During this peer review process the manuscript can change substatially, which can be 
beneficial but can also remove information that can be useful to other scientists. Furthermore, once a manuscript is published, it can often be unavailable unless you pay subscription fees. Preprints can solve these problems as they are free and immediately available versions of manuscripts that will later undergo peer review in a journal. In addition, the public servers store all versions of the manuscript so data is never lost, even when a subsequent version no longer includes that data.

### How can preprint journal clubs help?
This project aims to develop resources to encourage the hosting of [preprint journal clubs](https://youtu.be/vBeZGzvzsos) at different research institutions around the world. By encouraging the reading of preprints among groups of scientists, we hope to increase awareness of preprints, tackle the assumption that preprints cannot be used responsibly just because they haven't been through the journal peer reviewed process, and to provide opportunitites for young scientists to practice reviewing scientific literature and writing feedback in a professional and constructive manner. These are key skills that should be developed by all scientists. By developing a Journal Club Worksheet, we hope to facilitate the easy uptake of the preprint journal club practice in institutes around the world. **Please join us and help us with our project!**

### How can you get involved?
