## WELCOME to Preprint Journal Club for ALL!!!

### What are preprints?
[Preprints](https://www.authorea.com/users/8850/articles/168656-what-is-a-preprint) are complete pieces of scientific work that have not yet been peer reviewed or published. Preprints are often the same manuscripts that are submitted to a journal for peer review, but are stored on freely accessible public servers such that they become available to the whole web community within 1-2 days from submission.

### How can preprints help fix the problems in publishing in biology?
Publishing in the biological sciences has become a much lenghtier process over the past 30 years and can take 1-2 years from journal submission to final publication. During this peer review process the manuscript can change substatially, which can be 
beneficial but can also remove information that can be useful to other scientists. Furthermore, once a manuscript is published, it can often be unavailable unless you pay subscription fees. Preprints can solve these problems as they are free and immediately available versions of manuscripts that will later undergo peer review in a journal. In addition, the public servers store all versions of the manuscript so data is never lost, even when a subsequent version no longer includes that data.

### How can preprint journal clubs help?
68% of the [ASAPbio survey](http://asapbio.org/survey) respondents felt that commentary/evaluation for preprints would make preprints more valuable to the scientific community. This project aims to develop resources to encourage the hosting of [preprint journal clubs](https://youtu.be/vBeZGzvzsos) at research institutions worldwide. By encouraging the reading and evaluation of preprints among groups of scientists, we hope to increase the awareness, usage, and value of preprints in the biological sciences. Additionally, we hope to tackle the assumption that preprints cannot be used responsibly because they haven't been through the journal peer review process. Furthermore, we hope preprint journal clubs will provide opportunitites for young scientists to practice reviewing scientific literature and writing feedback in a professional and constructive manner. These are key skills that should be developed by all scientists. By developing a Journal Club Worksheet, we hope to facilitate the easy uptake of the preprint journal club practice in institutes around the world. **Please join us and help us with our project!**

### How can you get involved?
If you are interested in helping us develop this project, or would like to host your own preprint journal club, please let us know by emailing samantha.j.hindle@gmail.com or daniela.saderi@gmail.com.

You can also get involved in the wider preprint community projects by signing up as an [ASAPbio Ambassador](http://asapbio.org/asapbio-ambassadors)
