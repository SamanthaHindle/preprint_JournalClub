## WELCOME to Preprint Journal Club for ALL!!!

### What are preprints?
[Preprints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjxRAhdbJu8&feature=youtu.be&t=5m36s) are complete but not yet published pieces of scientific work that are stored on a freely accessible public server. A preprint is often the exact same manuscript that is submitted to a journal, but is available to the whole web community within 1-2 days of submission, prior to peer review. 

### How can preprints help fix the problems in publishing in biology?
Publishing in the biological sciences has become a much lenghtier process over the past 30 years and can take 1-2 years from journal submission to final publication. During this peer review process the manuscript can change substatially, which can be 
beneficial but can also remove information that can be useful to other scientists.   


### How can preprint journal clubs help?


### How can you get involved?




We are passionate about Open Science (OS) and we believe preprints can help to promote it. This project aims to develop resources to encourage the hosting of preprint journal clubs at different research institutions around the world.
