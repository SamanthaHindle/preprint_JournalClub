## Preprint JC Starter Guidelines  

Is there a preprint JC running in your department? Wouldy you like to start one? Are you currently participating or running a conventional (postprint) JC in your department? Would you like to start discussing preprints at that JC but you don't know where to start? You are reading the right document!  

Here we will try to give you a few tips on how you could either start a Preprint JC from scratch or incorporate preprints into 
an existing postprint JC.

### How to start a Preprint JC in your institution  

1. *If you attend a regular (postprint) JC*, you can start by presenting a preprint whenever your turn to present comes. 

2. *If you do not currently attend a JC but there are JCs going on at your institution*, you can start by joining one (JCs are fun and a 
useful way to stay up to date with scientific topics of interest) and then present a preprint on the relevant topic when your turn comes. At the beginning of your presentation spend 2-3 minutes telling people what preprints are (most researchers already know what they are, but some students might not) and why you think it's important to read and discuss (and write) preprints (see the [Preprint JC Info Doc](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub/blob/master/Starter_Kit/PPJC_Info_Doc.md) for more info).  

3. *If you are not attending a JC and there aren't JCs that interest you*, you can start you own. To help you out with that, we have written a template email you can tweak and send to your department to recruit students, postdoc, and even faculty to join the Preprint JC.
