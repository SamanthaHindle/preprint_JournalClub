## Preprint JC Info Doc

### What are preprints?
[Preprints](https://www.authorea.com/users/8850/articles/168656-what-is-a-preprint) are complete pieces of scientific work that have not yet been peer reviewed or published. Preprints are often the same manuscripts that are submitted to a journal for peer review, but are stored on freely accessible public servers (repositories) such that they become available to the whole web community within 1-2 days from submission. Usually preprints are posted on preprint repositories (see below) either before or at the same time as submission to a journal. Most journals will accept manuscripts that have previously been submitted to a preprint repository (check out [SHERPA/ROMEO](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php) to learn about publishers’ copyright policies and self-archiving). 
 
 
### How did the idea of submitting manuscripts to preprint repositories arise?
Approximately 25 years ago, around the time of the invention of the world wide web, a physicists called Paul Ginsparg realized that he could harness the power of the internet to improve the way new discoveries are communicated within the Physics community. He developed the freely accessible repository for Physics preprints called arXiv, which runs out of the Cornell University Library and is now host to cutting-edge research in the fields of Physics, Computational Science, Mathematics, Quantitative Finance, Statistics, and Quantitative Biology. 
 
As a result of arXiv’s success and because of the many problems with the archaic model of publishing in the biological and biomedical sciences (see below), a scientist-driven initiative was launched to promote the use of preprints in these biological fields. This initiative was named ASAPbio, which stands for Accelerating Science and Publishing in biology, and was spearheaded by Ron Vale (Professor at UCSF), along with Jessica Polka (then a postdoc at Harvard University and now Director of ASAPbio), Harold Varmus (Professor at Cornell University)  and Daniel Colón-Ramos (HHMI Faculty Scholar). 
 
Prior to the first ASAPbio meeting in February 2016, preprint repositories did exist for the biological sciences. However, awareness of their existence, and therefore their use, was minimal. The February 2016 ASAPbio meeting changed this by bringing together representatives from all aspects of scientific research, funding, and publishing to discuss whether preprints could be used in the biological sciences, like the Physicists had been doing for 25 years. This first meeting, held at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Headquarters, set the ball rolling for what has been an exciting and, one would like to say, revolutionary progression towards open and rapid access to cutting-edge scientific discoveries. A summary of this meeting can be found in an article written in [_Science_](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6288/899.full).
 
Subsequent meetings were held in May 2016 at the National Institutes of Health and in August 2016 at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, first to specifically engage private and public funding agencies to determine their interest in supporting the use of preprints as evidence of productivity in grant proposals, and also to discuss interest in funding a centralized preprint service for biologists. The role of this Central Service would be to aggregate content from current preprint repositories to enhance their discoverability and promote their integration into the daily lives of scientists. One would envision scientists searching the Central Service in the same way they search Pubmed and Web of Science to keep abreast of the most up-to-date research in their field, but in this case the discoveries would literally be current (weeks to months old), compared to the often 1-2 year delay before discoveries are finally published. These meetings were a resounding success (see summaries [here](http://asapbio.org/summary-of-the-asapbio-funders-workshop) and [here](https://riojournal.com/articles.php?id=11825)) and resulted in a massive $1 million award to ASAPbio from the Helmsley Charitable Trust to develop the Central Service for preprints in biology. Furthermore, many funding agencies, including the Helmsley Charitable Trust, the Medical Research Council, the Wellcome Trust, the NIH, and the Human Frontiers Science Program, to name a few, changed their policies to allow, and encourage, the citing of preprint manuscripts as evidence of productivity in grant proposals. These developments, together with the gradual acceptance of preprints by Journals, and by Institutions when screening job applications, has led to an explosion of [posting of preprints](http://asapbio.org/preprint-info/biology-preprints-over-time) on online repositories. But we don’t want to stop there. Preprints not only have benefits in bringing the most up-to-date research to the whole web within days of submission, but they also provide a ripe opportunity for early career researchers to develop their skills at critically reviewing scientific manuscripts. More about this below.
 
 
### Why are preprints important to scientific progression? 
As alluded to above, there are many problems with the current publishing system due to their foundations being based on an archaic model put forward by The Royal Society in 1665. This model has several positive components to ensure only the most robust scientific discoveries are published, including the advent of peer review, and also to provide priority of discovery based on the publication date. However, in the current internet age, this model is very slow and therefore causes stagnation of scientific progression and, quite frankly, zaps the life and excitement out of research. On an even more serious note, this archaic model has encouraged the development of a multi-million dollar publishing industry where the proposed impact rather than the robustness of the research, more often than not, forms the basis of acceptance for publications,  which is exactly the opposite of the original purpose of publishing back in 1665. Furthermore, due to the elitist nature of some of these “top tier” journals, scientific success is primarily judged on the number of publications in these high impact journals, rather than on the contribution that their research has actually made to the scientific community, and the world at large.  As a result, scientists feel pressured to produce research that is ‘worthy’ of publication in those high impact journals in order to be seen as successful, leading to over-inflation and sometimes fabrication of scientific results. This is obviously a serious problem and is why there was a real need for innovations, like the posting of preprints, to mend this broken system.
 
Preprints hold the promise of bringing research back to the reason we all practice science: to test hypotheses and generate new knowledge that will help us tackle many of the scientific challenges in the world. By posting research first to an open repository, this separates/dissociates the research from the reward component, enabling researchers to focus on producing robust data, without feeling pressured to produce impactful data. This is a crucial endeavour to prevent the encouragement of bad scientific practices.
 
 
### Why incorporate preprints into JC discussions and why write a review/send comments to authors?
In order for preprints to be embraced by all scientists, the incentives to submit preprints need to be well established. This includes funding agencies encouraging/enforcing these practices, and Institutions accepting preprints as evidence of research success. Whilst these policy changes are beginning to occur, we believe the incorporation of preprints into journal club practices, and the writing of preprint reviews, will provide an additional incentive for submitting preprints, both for the preprint JC host (in terms of training in review writing) and the preprint authors (from the insight and feedback gained from the PreprintJC review). In addition, by sending preprint reviews directly to the preprint corresponding author, PreprintJC hosts can expand their network in their field of research, which may have a positive impact on their career. 
 
The incorporation of preprints into journal club practices should be a relatively simple process, but we understand that there are many scientists that are unaware of preprints, some that are resistant to them, and also there is often little training available for early career researchers in the art of writing a manuscript review. Therefore, as early-mid career scientists, we wanted to tackle this by generating some resources to help encourage the incorporation of preprints into journal clubs, or to help initiate a PreprintJC from scratch. We hope you will find the resources useful, and please let us know what you think by emailing us at preprintjc@gmail.com.
