### How to report bugs?

There are bound to be bugs in any project, and so we would love it if you could be on the lookout for any bugs, and raise an issue if you find one. Bugs can be anything - they could be with our conceptual design, with how we set something out, spelling mistakes or formatting errors, or anything else we haven't yet thought of.

If you notice a bug, then raise an issue and label it with the label 'bug'. Then anyone in the contributing community can get right on it, and everything gets fixed faster. THANK YOU!

We will have more details here soon but, for now, if you are interested in helping us develop this project, or would like to host your own preprint journal club, please let us know by emailing PreprintJC@gmail.com.

You can also get involved in the wider preprint community projects by signing up as an [ASAPbio Ambassador](http://asapbio.org/asapbio-ambassadors).

THANK YOU!!!
