## How to contribute to Preprint JC

Thank you for taking the time to contribute! We are excited to welcome contributors and we really value the time you take to work with us on this project.

### Contributing guidelines
Before getting started with contributing, please:
* Read the [README.md](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub/blob/master/README.md)
* Read the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

Please report any unacceptable behavior to PreprintJC@gmail.com.

### What are we working on right now?
Right now we are finalizing Stage II and also working on Phase III of this project (check out our [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub/blob/master/ROADMAP.md)). We have a shared google folder called [PreprintJC_shared_folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RmH0yhNtL0l75zYtwCELbaiRRwgyfXAVHu-SceMlyCM) that contains the developing Preprint JC Starter Kit materials, and you can also find the most up-to-date resources and example preprint reviews on our platform: [PREreview.org](https://prereview.org). If you would like to add your own review of a preprint, we would love to welcome you to the PREreview community. You can sign up and publish your review by [following these simple steps](https://prereview.org/users/8850/articles/199648-getting-started-on-prereview-a-step-by-step-guide). 

### How can you get involved?

Thank you soooooo much for reading this far! We are really excited that you want to help us and become part of the PREreview community! Here are some great first issues that we would absolutely :heart: your help with:

__1. Join our live Ask Me Anything: [#MozPREpreintAMA](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub/issues/14)__

This is ideal for anyone who wants to learn more about preprints or how best to start your own preprint journal club. We will have experts onboard who are excited about answering your questions such as:  
* "What is a preprint?"  
* "What licensing option should I chose when I submit my preprint?"<br/>
* "How can I encourage my lab mates to discuss preprints at journal clubs?" and  
* "Where can I learn more about writing up my preprint review?"<br/>
 
__2. If you are already discussing preprints at journal clubs, fill out our PREPRINT JC COMMUNITY FORM__ 

__3. Help us distribute the PREPRINT JC COMMUNITY FORM  and build a PREreview community using social media (#PreprintJC)__

__4. Join our [PREreview Ambassadors Program](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub/issues/13):__<br/>

We have a PREreview Ambassadors Slack Team where we share news about PREreview and updates to our resources. We also celebrate each new PREreview that is posted on our platform. **Most importantly**, we provide support for Ambassadors who are new to the idea of preprint JCs by generating a __community of experienced PREreviewers__ who are eager to share tips about running a preprint JC and great ways to make it easier to write up your first PREreview.

__5. Join us on our first ever [live, digital preprint journal club](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub/issues/):__

One of the main goals of our preprint JC project is to increase the diversity and inclusivity of the peer review process. To achieve this goal we are focusing on early career researchers and providing resources to lower the barrier to starting a preprint journal club. However, we realized that simply providing resources isn't always enough to level the playing field for  all early career researchers. Therefore, we decided to launch a series of online, digital preprint journal clubs to allow anyone with an internet connection to join the discussions, no matter where you are in the world. We will host our first ever live, digital preprint JC here at #Mozsprint2018 and we will start with a preprint about open science. Check out our issue here for more details. We hope to learn from you what worked well and what we can improve for future field-specific digital preprintJCs! Please join us and help us make peer review more inclusive! :heartdecoration: :heart: :heartdecoration:

__6. Help us develop our [Peer Review Mentoring Program](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub/issues/12):__  

We are passionate about supporting the training of early career researchers in peer review. When we started thinking about how to structure the training program, we thought "who better to turn to for guidance on building a community-based program: MOZILLA!" We had the fortune to learn from the **amazing Mozilla Open Leaders Program** and we would like to bring that energy, organizational prowess, and top-quality resources to our PREreview community. Please help us get our Mentoring Program off to a great start! Check out our [plan so far](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub/issues/12)  

__7. Add useful links and comments to our [RESOURCES.md](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub/blob/master/RESOURCES.md) file:__  

__8. If you would like to join the PREreview community and start your own PreprintJC, sign up [here]()__  


### How to report bugs?

There are bound to be bugs in any project, and so we would love it if you could be on the lookout for any bugs, and raise an issue if you find one. Bugs can be anything - they could be with our conceptual design, with how we set something out, spelling mistakes or formatting errors, or anything else we haven't yet thought of.

If you notice a bug, then raise an issue and label it with the label 'bug'. Then anyone in the contributing community can get right on it, and everything gets fixed faster. THANK YOU! :heart:

We will have more details here soon but, for now, if you are interested in helping us develop this project, or would like to host your own Preprint JC, please let us know by emailing PreprintJC@gmail.com.

You can also get involved in the wider preprint community projects by signing up as an [ASAPbio Ambassador](http://asapbio.org/asapbio-ambassadors).

THANK YOU!!!
