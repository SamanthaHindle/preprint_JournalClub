### What are we working on right now?
Right now we are at Stage I of this project (check out our [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub/blob/master/ROADMAP.md)) and we are getting ready for the [Mozilla Global Sprint](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/) on June 1-2 #mozsprint.  
We have a google folder called [PreprintJC_shared_folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RmH0yhNtL0l75zYtwCELbaiRRwgyfXAVHu-SceMlyCM) that contains our google docs (see our issues) and a couple of example preprint JC feedback reviews (they are not meant to be the best examples). Feel free to add your own review to a preprint as a google doc.

These are some tasks for you if you want to contribute at this stage: 
 
* Fill out our [community opinion survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMphGFDxwCfGgmEj-CzbkdVZJs-atV1gHZPE6ZB13xNF8HIw/viewform?usp=sf_link)
* Help us distribute our [community opinion survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMphGFDxwCfGgmEj-CzbkdVZJs-atV1gHZPE6ZB13xNF8HIw/viewform?usp=sf_link) and build a community using social media (#PreprintJC)
* Help us develop a [Preprint Review Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RmH0yhNtL0l75zYtwCELbaiRRwgyfXAVHu-SceMlyCM/edit?usp=sharing)
* Help us write Preprint Journal Club Guidelines based on Prachee Avasthi's syllabus [here](http://asapbio.org/10-ways)
* Add useful links and comments to our [RESOURCES.md](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub/blob/master/RESOURCES.md) file
* If you would like to help us test our Preprint Journal Club Guidelines, sign up as a beta-tester [here](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub/projects/4)

### How to report bugs?

There are bound to be bugs in any project, and so we would love it if you could be on the lookout for any bugs, and raise an issue if you find one. Bugs can be anything - they could be with our conceptual design, with how we set something out, spelling mistakes or formatting errors, or anything else we haven't yet thought of.

If you notice a bug, then raise an issue and label it with the label 'bug'. Then anyone in the contributing community can get right on it, and everything gets fixed faster. THANK YOU!

We will have more details here soon but, for now, if you are interested in helping us develop this project, or would like to host your own preprint journal club, please let us know by emailing PreprintJC@gmail.com.

You can also get involved in the wider preprint community projects by signing up as an [ASAPbio Ambassador](http://asapbio.org/asapbio-ambassadors).

THANK YOU!!!
