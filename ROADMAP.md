## Preprint Journal Club

**Welcome to the Preprint Journal Club community! We are thrilled to meet you!** 
We are passionate about Open Science (OS) and we believe [preprints](https://youtu.be/2zMgY8Dx9co) can help to promote it. This project aims to develop resources to encourage the hosting of preprint journal clubs at different research institutions around the world.

Read more about our vision in our [README.md](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub/blob/master/README.md#preprint_journalclub).
