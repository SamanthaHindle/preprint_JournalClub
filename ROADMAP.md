**Welcome to the Preprint Journal Club community! We are thrilled to meet you!** 
You can read more about our vision in our [README.md](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub/blob/master/README.md#preprint_journalclub) file but, in brief, we are passionate about open science and we believe preprints can help to promote this. To increase awareness and interaction with preprints, we propose to initiate and develop resources to encourage the hosting of preprint journal clubs
