## Preprint Journal Club

**Welcome to the Preprint Journal Club community! We are thrilled to meet you!** 
We are passionate about Open Science (OS) and we believe [preprints](https://youtu.be/2zMgY8Dx9co) can help to promote it. This project aims to develop resources to encourage the hosting of preprint journal clubs at different research institutions around the world.

Read more about our vision in our [README.md](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub/blob/master/README.md#preprint_journalclub).

### How to get involved

We will have more details here soon but, for now, if you are interested in helping us develop this project, or would like to host your own preprint journal club, please let us know by emailing samantha.j.hindle@gmail.com or daniela.saderi@gmail.com.

You can also get involved in the wider preprint community projects by signing up as an [ASAPbio Ambassador](http://asapbio.org/asapbio-ambassadors)

### Timeline

- [ ] Get feedback from beta testers

#### Stage III
