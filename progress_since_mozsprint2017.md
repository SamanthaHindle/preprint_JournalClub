## PREreviewâ€™s Progress Since Mozsprint2017!

* June 1-2, 2017: Sam and Daniela attended the Mozilla Global Sprint (Sam, from Mountain View, CA, and Daniela, from Portland, OR) and developed the first [Preprint Journal Club Community Survey](https://goo.gl/forms/dItKvE0OoSGvy5y63) that was launched shortly after. The survey was closed at the end of August with 102 participants (survey results summarized [here](https://prereview.org/users/153686/articles/206118-preprint-journal-clubs-your-opinions-revealed). During the Sprint we also applied for the Mozilla Mini Grant and were awarded $2,000 later in September ([full application here](https://prereview.org/users/164141/articles/282554-mozilla-mini-grant-application-june-3-2017)).
* September 15, 2017: Thanks to the help of Josh Nicholson and the rest of the Authorea team, we launched PREreview.org and started to upload our developed resources. We started a @PREreview_ Twitter account to spread the word to the community.
* October 25, 2017: Thanks to Naomi Penfold, we posted an overview of our work at PREreview on [eLIFE Labs](https://elifesciences.org/labs/57d6b284/prereview-a-new-resource-for-the-collaborative-review-of-preprints).
* October 27-28, 2017: We attended the Mozilla Festival and led a session on preprints and the future of scholarly publication (summary and notes from the session [here](https://prereview.org/users/164141/articles/209014-mozfest-2017-session-changing-the-scientific-publishing-ecosystem-preprints-and-beyond)).
* November, 2017: We officially started our beta testing phase recruiting 18 volunteer beta testers (guideline for beta testers [here](https://prereview.org/users/164141/articles/264761-prereview-beta-testing-phase-here-is-how-you-can-help)). We are still collecting feedback from PREreview journal club participants and preprint authors in the form of participant and author surveys. We will share these results once our beta testing phase is complete.
* January 30, 2018: We announced our amazing [Advisory Board](https://prereview.org/users/153686/articles/254102-prereview-meet-our-advisory-board).
* February 7-8, 2018: We wrote a [commentary](http://asapbio.org/prereviewers) for the HHMI/ASAPbio/Wellcome Trust Transparency, Recognition, and Innovation in Peer Review in the Life Sciences meeting in the hope of gaining support and collaborative partnerships from meeting attendees and the wider community. Sam attended the meeting and spoke with several stakeholders about incentivizing ECRs to start their own preprint journal clubs and use PREreview. 
* March 4, 2018: We were interviewed by Flavio Rump of bio2040, a podcast and blog dedicated to uncovering the biggest opportunities in healthcare and biotech. This episode will be released in the next few weeks.
* March 13, 2018: Collaboration established with Almetric to integrate PREreviews into their peer review metrics. 
* March 20, 2018: PREreviews are now discoverable from the appropriate bioRxiv preprints (e.g., [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/20/170506)). 
* March 23, 2018: We held our first Advisory Board meeting were we discussed our past achievements and mapped out our future roadmap
* March 23, 2018: Monica Granados joined the PREreview Team
* May 10-11, 2018: Daniela joined the eLife Innovation Sprint in Cambridge, and Sam and Monica joined the Mozilla Global Sprint in Toronto. During the sprints, we developed plans for the new PREreview2.0 platform (more information can be found at our [PREreview2.0 Github repo](https://github.com/PREreview)) and launched our first Live PREreview preprint journal club (#PREJC) to help make preprint discussions more inclusive. You can read more about our sprinting events [here,](https://elifesciences.org/labs/bdd4c9aa/elife-innovation-sprint-2018-project-roundup) [here,](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub/issues/16) [here,](https://www.prereview.org/users/164141/articles/301936-live-prereview-journal-clubs-liveprejc) and [here](https://www.prereview.org/users/153686/articles/303147-live-prereview-journal-club-on-a-measure-of-open-data-a-metric-and-analysis-of-reusable-data-practices-in-biomedical-data-resources)
* June 22-24, 2018: PREreview attended the ELPUB conference in Toronto, where we presented a poster about PREreview and discussed issues around open and inclusive scholarly publishing.
* June 27, 2018: Sam presented PREreview and joined a discussion about new innovations to increase awareness and engagement in preprints as a panelist for the [eLife Ambassadors webinar](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/0c18df6f/webinar-report-supporting-preprints-in-the-life-sciences). 
* July 25-27, 2018: PREreview attended the OSAOS and Code for Science & Society/COKO Foundation Open Science Guidebook hackathon where we contributed content from our experiences launching PREreview as an open project.
* August 6, 2018: PREreview, in collaboration with Outbreak Science, submitted a grant proposal to the Wellcome Trust Open Research Fund to support the development of Rapid PREreview, a new tool to facilitate rapid and timely community feedback (and its smart visualization) on emerging preprints during public health crises.
